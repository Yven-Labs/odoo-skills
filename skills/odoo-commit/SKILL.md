## Critical Rules

- ALWAYS use conventional-commits format: `type(scope): description`
- ALWAYS keep the first line under 72 characters
- ALWAYS ask for user confirmation before committing
- NEVER be overly specific (avoid counts like "6 files", "3 rules")
- NEVER include implementation details in the title
- NEVER use `git push --force` or `git push -f`
- NEVER proactively offer to commit — wait for user to explicitly request it

## Commit Format

```text
type(scope): concise description

- Key change 1
- Key change 2
- Key change 3
```

### Types

| Type       | Use When                           |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature or functionality       |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                            |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                 |
| `chore`    | Maintenance, dependencies, configs |
| `refactor` | Code change without feature/fix    |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests           |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement            |
| `style`    | Formatting, no code change         |

### Scopes

| `docs`        | Documentation-only changes                             |
| *omit*        | Changes affecting multiple scopes                      |

## Good vs Bad Examples

### Title Line

```text
# GOOD — Concise and clear
feat(orm): add sale order line computed field for margin
fix(views): correct invisible condition in invoice form (v17+)
chore(security): add ir.model.access for res.partner extension
docs: update module readme with installation steps

# BAD — Too specific or verbose
feat(orm): add computed field for margin on sale.order.line with @api.depends on price_unit
fix(views): fix line 45 in sale_order_form.xml where invisible was using deprecated attrs
```

### Body Bullets

```text
# GOOD — High-level changes
- Add version-aware routing for v17 and v18
- Define Odoo-specific scopes for commit strategy
- Include Skill ID verification rules

# BAD — Too granular
- Add routing logic on line 45 for v17.0.x manifest patterns
- Update 3 lines in setup.sh to fix the if-block on line 23
```

## Workflow

1. **Check status**:
```bash
git status
git diff --stat HEAD
git log -3 --oneline
```

2. **Draft commit message**
   - Choose appropriate type and scope
   - Write concise title (< 72 chars)
   - Add 2-5 bullet points for significant changes

3. **Present to user for confirmation**
   - Show files to be committed
   - Show proposed message
   - Wait for explicit confirmation

4. **Execute**:
```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type(scope): description

- Change 1
- Change 2
EOF
)"
```

## Decision Tree

```text
Single file changed?
├─ Yes → Title only (omit body)
└─ No  → Include body bullets

Multiple scopes affected?
├─ Yes → Omit scope: `feat: description`
└─ No  → Include scope: `feat(orm): description`

Fixing a bug?
├─ User-facing error → fix(scope): description
└─ Internal issue   → chore(scope): fix description

Adding documentation?
├─ Code comments only → Part of the feat or fix
└─ Standalone docs   → docs: or docs(scope):
```

## ODSK Integrity Check (Only When Contributing to odoo-skills)

If you are contributing to the `odoo-skills` library itself:
1. Verify every new `SKILL.md` has a `Skill ID` in its metadata.
2. Verify all Markdown code blocks have a language identifier.
3. Run `sync.sh` (when available) to validate UID uniqueness.

For standard Odoo project commits (models, views, security, etc.), this check does NOT apply.
